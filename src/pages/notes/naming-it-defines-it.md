I saw something at work that surprised me. Large design documents, complicated product specs, slack threads and channels - all around Project Geppetto. 

Project Geppetto has nothing to do with puppet maker. It involves complex financial systems, tooling, and social behavior. I was having trouble making the connection. I thought for a while before giving up. I got nothing, so I asked.

It turns out I was on the right track. Geppetto really does have nothing to do with the project. It’s a nonsensical name, chosen for the purpose of being nonsensical. 

Why? Because names have power. 

Let's take a hypothetical: You are tasked with keeping the citizens of your village warm. 

The mayor staffs you on “project gloves and coats”. You find novel ways to stretch what little budget you have, connecting suppliers and truckers. You negotiate deals and make calls. An outlet store has overstock. 

A few weeks in, you come to realize that tweaks to your HVAC infrastructure would quickly eclipse any improvements from attire. A heat pump and some caulk would both warm the village and save money.

But that's for someone else to tackle - our job is to procure gloves and coats.

Names can blind you to the actual goals.
